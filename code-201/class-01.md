# Getting Started

## How the Web Works
#### 1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.


#### 2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
- The browser parses the HTML file first which allows the browswer to identify any linked elements that may be on an external CSS stylesheet.
- As the browser parses the HTML, it requests back to the server for any CSS files found from *link* elements, and any JavaScript files that has been found from *script* elements. From those, the browser then parses the CSS and JavaScript.


#### 3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
- You can easily search through Google Images for an image. 
- **Note**: most images on the internet, including Google Images, are copyrighted. To minimize the liklihood of violating a copyright, use Google's license filter. 
- **How To**:
    - Click on the *Tools* button.
    - Click *Usage rights*.
    - Choose the option *Creative Commons licenses*.
        


#### 4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
- String: you enclose text within singe quotes (' ') OR double quotes (" ").
- Number: you simply write out the digits: 
let thisNumber = 10; 
    


#### 5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
- Variables are containers that store values. A user begins by declaring a variable with the 'let' keyword, followed by the chosen name for said variable.
- Variables are necessary in order to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then developers couldn't do anything dynamic; like personalize a greeting message.

## Introduction to HTML
#### 1. What is an HTML attribute?
- Attributes contain extra information about an HTML element that will not appear in the rendered content.
- An attribute should have:
    * A space between it and the element name.
    * The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
    * An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.



#### 2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
- The opening tag: Consists of the element name. This tag marks where the element begins to take effect.
The content: This contains the content of the element.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, exept that this tag includes a forward slash before the element name. This indicated where the element ends. Failing to close tags is often a commone beginner mistake.


#### 3. What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
- 


#### 4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?



#### 5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?



#### 6. How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
