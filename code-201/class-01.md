# Getting Started

## How the Web Works
#### 1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.


#### 2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
- The browser parses the HTML file first which allows the browswer to identify any linked elements that may be on an external CSS stylesheet.
- As the browser parses the HTML, it requests back to the server for any CSS files found from *link* elements, and any JavaScript files that has been found from *script* elements. From those, the browser then parses the CSS and JavaScript.


#### 3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
- You can easily search through Google Images for an image. 
- **Note**: most images on the internet, including Google Images, are copyrighted. To minimize the liklihood of violating a copyright, use Google's license filter. 
- **How To**:
    - Click on the *Tools* button.
    - Click *Usage rights*.
    - Choose the option *Creative Commons licenses*.
        


#### 4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
- String: you enclose text within singe quotes (' ') OR double quotes (" ").
- Number: you simply write out the digits: 
let thisNumber = 10; 
    


#### 5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
