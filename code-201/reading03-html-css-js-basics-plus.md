# HTML Lists, JavaScript Control Flow, and the CSS Box Model

## Learn HTML
#### [Ordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and [Unordered Lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)
1. When should you use an `unordered list` ( `<ul>` ) in your HTML document?
- Use it when grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in said list is meaningless.
- Unordered lists are usually displayed with a bullet which can take on several forms such as a dot, a circle, or a square.
- The bullet styling is not defined in the actual HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the `list-style-type` property.

2. How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?
- As mentioned above, bullet styling is defined by its associated CSS.
- This is done using the `list-style-type` property.

3. When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unordered list` in your HTML document?
- A developer should use an `ordered list` element ( `<ol>` ) if the order of said list is meaningful.
  * Steps in a recipe
  * Turn-by-turn directions

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?
- This can be done by applying *global attributes*
  I. `reversed` - this Boolean attribute specifies that the list items are in reverse order and items will be numbered from high to low.

  II. `type` will affect how the list is numbered.
  * `a` for lowercase letters.
  * `A` for uppercase letters.
  * `i` for lowercase Roman numerals.
  * `I` for uppercase Roman numerals.
  * `1` for numbers ( default ).


## Learn CSS
#### [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

## Learn JavaScript
#### [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays), [Operators & Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), [Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals), and [Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code)

1. What *data types* can you store inside of an **Array**?
- 

2. Is the `people` array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?


3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
