# Audio. Video. Images.
### [Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

#### 1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
- The first influx of videos and audio files online were made availabe and possible by proprietary plugin-based tehcnologies. 
- I.E. Flash and Silverlight
  * Both of these had security and accessibility issues.
  * They have since become obsolete in favor of native HTML solutions `<video>` and `<audio>` elements plus the availability of JavaScript APIs for controlling them.


#### 2. Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.
- `src` (source): this attribute contains a path to the video that the developer wants to embed. It works in exactly the same way as the `<img>` element.
- `controls`: a user must be able to control the video or audio playback; this becomes particularly critical for people who experience epilepsy. A developer must either use the `controls` attribute to include the browser's own control interface OR build an interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. 
  * At the very least, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

#### 3. Why is it important to have **fallback content** inside the `<video>` element?
- **Fallback content** is what will be displayed to the user in the event that the browser accessing the page does not support the `<video>` element. 
  * This allows developers to provide a *fallback* for older browsers. 
  * This could be anything the developer likes it to be. In the example that [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content#video_and_audio_on_the_web) provided, they connected a direct link to the video file, so that the user can access it regardless of what browser they are using.

#### 4. Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.
- `<audio>` and `<video>` are like Pippen and Jordan early in their careers. The early 2000s Flash and Silverlight limitations are akin to the Detroit Pistons Bad Boys. Everyone knew that Chicago had something special but they just needed to get around the limitations of the time before they could really explode and become the dynasty they were meant to be. Knowing what they had together coupled with staying the course and believing, allowed them to build something that became nearly unstoppable.
