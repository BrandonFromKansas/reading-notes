## CSS Layout
[Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow) and [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)
#### 1. What is meant by “normal flow”?
- This is the default way that webpage elements lay themselves out if a developer has not changed the layout.

#### 2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?
- Block level: a block-level element's content fill all available inline space of its parent element, "growing along the block dimension to accommodate its content.", as per [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
- Inline level: the size of an inline-level element is only the size of its content.

#### 3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
- "Box model"

#### 4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
- It means that a developer can create separte and isolated user interface (UI) features and they won't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. 
- UI features such as:
  * Pop-up info boxes
  * Control menus
  * Rollover panels
  * UI features which can be dragged and dropped anywhere on said page.


#### 5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
- Fixed positioning works exactly the same way as Absolute positioning exept that: it *usually* fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.
- By using **fixed positioning*, developers can create helpful UI items which are fixed in place, like navigation bars that stay visible even as the user scrolls through the web page.


## Learn JS
[Functions: Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)
