# Markdown

## What is markdown?
- As per the article, it is a "lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents." Since it's creation in 2004 by *John Gruber*, it is now one of the most popular markup languages in the world. (source: https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/ )

## Why do we use markdown?
- Markdown has been described as *future-proof*. Meaning that even if the application you're using to write a markdown-formatted text stops working or becomes obsolete, the formatted text will still be readable. Markdown does not require any specially licensed program in order to write or read it.
- Markdown-formatted text is also easily portable since and can be created on any device using any operating system. 

## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
- The pound symbol "**#**" can be used to create a main heading. One pound symbol will denote the biggest possible heading for a Markdown-formatted document.
- The number of pounds signs denotes the size of the heading. For example, one "#" will make the following text the biggest heading. A creator can use up to six pound symbols to create smaller headings as the document dictates. With each added "#" creating a smaller heading, using up to a max of six "#" symbols.

## When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use an asterisk "*".
- Adding two asterisks at the beginning and end of a word or phrase will bolden it. 
- Adding one asterisk at the beginning and end of a word or phrase will italicize it.
