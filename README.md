# Growth Mindset
- A growth mindset is the belief that anyone can learn new and/or improve their abilities through discipline, learning, practice and application.

## Maintaining a Growth Mindset
1. I have a habit of staying fixed on a problem and just grinding until it's fixed or I get frustrated and walk away. With time management being a huge part of this curriculum, I know that I cannot afford to do that. *Especailly* when help is just a REMO ticket away. So, I have a sticky note, next to my workspace that reads **"15 minutes"** as a reminder to break that habit and use the resources available to me.
1. Beginning each class with a mental checklist to make sure that I am approaching the day in the right frame of mind. Mentally prepare for coming up against topics that are completely new to me, and just being ready to embrace any challeges or struggles.
1. Making sure to schedule time away from the computer and outside of the house. Even on days when the weather isn't the greatest, just being outside for a while helps clear my head and really helps to maintain a better perspective.
