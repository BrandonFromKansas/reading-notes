### [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

#### 1. What is a "component"?
- "A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface." - Credit [tutorialspoint.com](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

#### 2. What are the characteristics of a component?
- **Reusability**: Componnets are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
- **Replaceable**: Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
- **Not context specific**: Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
- **Extensible**: A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
- **Encapsulated**: A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose detaisl fo the internal pocesses or any internal variables or states.
- **Independent**: Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
