# What is CSS?

### What is the purpose of CSS?
- To specify how documents/websites are presented to users - how they are styled.


### What are the 3 ways to insert CSS into your project?
1. External CSS: with an external style sheet, a user can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.
1. Internal CSS: an internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
1. Inline CSS: used to apply a unique style for a **single** element.
