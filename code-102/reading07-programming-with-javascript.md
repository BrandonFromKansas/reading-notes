### 1. What is control flow?
- The order in which a computer executes statements in a script.
- "Code is run in order from the first line to the last line unless the computer runs across (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops." - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow


### 2. What is a JavaScript function?
- [JavaScript Function](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)
- is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- is executed when "something" *invokes* it or, *calls* it.


### 3. What does it mean to *invoke* or *call* a function?

    - The code inside the function will execute when "something" *invokes* (calls) the function:
        - When an event occurs (user clicking a button)
        - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code.
        - Automatically (self invoked).
