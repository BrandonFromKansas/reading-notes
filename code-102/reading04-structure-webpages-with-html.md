# Structuring Web Pages with HTML

#### What is HTML and why do we use it?
- HTML (**H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) is the code used in order to structure a web page and the content it contains.
-It is used to structure and format web pages in order to make them more user friendly. Having a well formatted website helps our brains read text, decipher information, move throughout the page easily, and makes digesting all that content a bit easier.


#### What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
1. Opening tag. Example: **<**p**>**
1. Content. Everything that comes after the opening tag.
1. Closing tag. Example: **</p>**


#### What is it called when you give an element extra information?
- An attribute.
- Attributes contain extra information about an element that the creator does not want to appear in the actual rendered content.

#### What is a semantic element?
- Semantics refers to the *meaning* of a piece of code.
- For HTML, the **h1** *element* gives the text that it encompases the role of "top level heading for your page."
