# Choosing a Text Editor

## 4 Features a Code Editor should have:
1. Code completion: allows a user to begin typing and the editor will display potential suggestions to go along what was originally typed. This feature is beneficial for saving time and reducing the amount of typos.
1. Syntax highlighting: depending on the piece of code a user is working on, a good editor will colorzie the text to make pieces of the code easier to read and sift throught when potentially looking for errors.
1. Theme variety: Some coders prefer darker backgrounds with brightly colored text and some prefer the opposite. Some people have eye conditions that dictate what they are able to look at for long periods of time. Perhaps a lighter theme allows some users to code without getting a headache which coudl easily be someone else's reasoing as to why they prefer a darker theme. 
1. Extension availability: These allow users to beef up their reipitoire by adding more tools to their coding toolbox as their expereince grows as well.

## Commands and their functions:
- pwd: Print Working Directory: lists which current directory the user is working within.
- ls: List: allows user to see and know what all is in a specific directory.
- cd: Change Directory: allows the user to switch from one directory to another. Note: typing just "cd" without any arguments will always take the user back to their home directory.
- mkdir: Make Directory: allows users to create and name a new directory.
- touch: Creates a new empty file.

## Scenarios
1. cd projects : This will change the working directory to the one titled "projects".
1. mkdir new-project : creates a new directory labeled "new-project" within the current working directory.
1. touch new-project/newfile.md : creates a Markdown file titled "newfile.md" within the folder labeled "new-project".
1. cd .. : takes the user "back" or "up" by one directory.
1. ls projects/new-project : There is a directory labeled "projects". Within that directory is a sub-directory labeled "new-project". This command would list any files contained within the "new project" folder.
